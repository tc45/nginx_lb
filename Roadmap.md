# NGINX Manager Roadmap

## Project Vision

Transform the NGINX Manager into a comprehensive hybrid load balancing solution that seamlessly integrates on-premises infrastructure with cloud resources. The system will automatically detect failures in the primary on-premises environment and dynamically provision cloud-based servers to maintain service availability and performance.

## Planned Features

### 1. Cloud Failover Capabilities

**Description:**  
Implement automated detection and failover to cloud resources when on-premises servers fail or become unavailable.

**Key Components:**
- Health monitoring system for on-premises servers with configurable thresholds
- Cloud provider integration (AWS, Azure, GCP) for automated server provisioning
- Dynamic NGINX configuration updates to route traffic to newly provisioned cloud servers
- Automatic DNS updates to reflect infrastructure changes
- Configurable thresholds for triggering failover events

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use cloud provider APIs for server provisioning and management
- Implement a state management system to track on-premises and cloud resources
- Create a configuration system for cloud credentials and resource specifications

### 2. Enhanced Management UI

**Description:**  
Develop an improved user interface for managing NGINX configurations, server status, and failover settings.

**Key Components:**
- Text-based interactive dashboard using terminal UI libraries (curses, tabulate)
- Real-time server health visualization with color-coded status indicators
- Configuration management interface with validation
- Historical performance metrics and status changes
- Event logs for failover activities and configuration changes

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use Python's curses library for terminal-based UI
- Implement a modular design to allow future web-based UI development
- Create a consistent navigation system and help documentation

### 3. Portable Installation System

**Description:**  
Develop a comprehensive installation script to simplify deployment across various environments.

**Key Components:**
- One-command installation process for all dependencies
- Environment detection and adaptation
- Configuration wizard for initial setup
- Validation of system requirements and dependencies
- Support for containerized deployment (Docker)

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Create modular installation scripts for different operating systems
- Implement proper error handling and recovery during installation
- Provide detailed logs for troubleshooting installation issues

### 4. Git-Based Backup System

**Description:**  
Implement automated backup of configurations and settings to Git repositories with GitHub integration.

**Key Components:**
- Automatic versioning of NGINX configurations
- Scheduled commits to local Git repository
- Secure GitHub integration for remote backups
- Detailed commit messages with change information
- Rollback functionality to restore previous configurations

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use GitPython library for repository management
- Implement encryption for sensitive configuration data
- Create a user-friendly interface for viewing configuration history

### 5. CI/CD Pipeline for Testing

**Description:**  
Establish a continuous integration and deployment pipeline to validate NGINX configurations and test failover capabilities.

**Key Components:**
- Automated testing of NGINX configurations for syntax and semantic errors
- Load testing for performance validation
- Simulated failure scenarios to test failover mechanisms
- Integration tests for cloud provider APIs
- Regular security scanning of configurations

**Implementation Considerations:**
- Use GitHub Actions or Jenkins for pipeline automation
- Implement test environments that mirror production
- Create comprehensive test scenarios for various failure modes
- Generate detailed test reports for review

- Develop cost optimization features for cloud resources
- Create advanced reporting and analytics

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Secure storage of cloud provider credentials
- Encryption of sensitive configuration data
- Role-based access control for management interface

### Scalability
- Support for multiple cloud providers
- Handling large numbers of servers and configurations
- Performance optimization for real-time monitoring

### Reliability
- Redundant monitoring systems
- Failsafe mechanisms to prevent cascading failures
- Comprehensive logging for troubleshooting

## Success Metrics

- Reduction in downtime during server failures
- Decrease in manual intervention for failover events
- Improved visibility into system health and performance
- Reduced time to deploy new configurations
- Increased confidence in configuration changes through automated testing
